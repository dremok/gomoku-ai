# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Environment Setup

**Important**: This project uses a conda environment named `gomoku`. Always activate it before running any commands:

```bash
conda activate gomoku
```

# Workarounds, Fallbacks & Heuristics
 
- Avoid "workarounds", "heuristics", and other garbage you might reach for when you don't understand the issue.
- If you think a heuristic is useful, then you are definitely wrong and this means we are taking a wrong approach.
- You MUST consider breaking out of local maxima in case you try to use heuristics.

## Development Approach

**Critical**: This project must be developed incrementally with verification at each small checkpoint. Never implement multiple components at once without testing.

### Development Workflow
1. **Small Steps**: Implement one small component at a time (e.g., single function, single class method)
2. **Immediate Testing**: After each implementation, write and run tests to verify it works correctly
3. **Checkpoint Verification**: Before moving to the next component, ensure current code runs without errors
4. **Incremental Building**: Each new component should build on verified, working foundations

### Example Incremental Approach
- Implement `Board.__init__()` ‚Üí test board creation
- Add `Board.apply_move()` ‚Üí test move application  
- Add `Board.legal_moves()` ‚Üí test legal move generation
- Add basic win detection for one direction ‚Üí test with simple cases
- Extend to all four directions ‚Üí test edge cases
- Only then move to next major component

**Never skip verification steps**. If something doesn't work at a checkpoint, fix it immediately before proceeding.

### Critical: Always Stay in Baby Steps Mode
**NEVER** ask whether to move to "the next major component" vs "another baby step". This is a false choice that misunderstands the methodology.

- **Every step is a baby step** - this never changes
- Moving to a new major component IS a baby step if that's the natural next progression
- Baby steps continue throughout the entire development process
- The question is always: "What is the next natural baby step?" - whether that's within current functionality or starting something new

Example correct thinking:
- ‚úÖ "The next baby step is to add basic draw detection"  
- ‚úÖ "The next baby step is to start implementing Game class initialization"
- ‚ùå "Should we move to the next major component or continue with baby steps?"

Stay in baby step mode always. Each step builds incrementally on verified, working foundations.

### Critical: Dependency Management
**ALWAYS** update `requirements.txt` when installing new packages. This is essential for:
- Reproducible environments
- Team collaboration
- Deployment consistency

After installing any package with `pip install <package>`, immediately add it to `requirements.txt` with appropriate version constraints.

### Progress Tracking in README
**ALWAYS** update the "Current Progress" section in README.md after completing any milestone or significant component. This helps track development status and provides visibility into what's been accomplished.

**When to update README progress**:
- After completing a major component (e.g., Board class, win detection, agent implementation)
- After reaching a milestone checkpoint 
- After adding significant functionality that changes project status
- Before moving to a new development phase

**How to update**:
- Mark completed items with ‚úÖ
- Update "Next" item with üîÑ 
- Add recent accomplishments to "Recent Milestones Completed"
- Update overall "Status" to reflect current milestone progress

## Project Overview

This is a Gomoku AI project implementing a playable 15√ó15 board game with Deep Q-Learning (DQN) agent trained via self-play. The project follows Standard Gomoku rules (5-only) where wins require exactly 5 contiguous stones and overlines (‚â•6) do not count as wins.

## Key Architecture Decisions

- **Rules**: Standard Gomoku (5-only) - exactly 5 contiguous stones win, overlines invalid
- **Board**: 15√ó15 grid, Black plays first
- **Framework**: PyTorch for AI components
- **UI**: Tkinter GUI with CLI fallback
- **Compute**: CPU-only (no GPU requirements)
- **State Representation**: `np.int8[15,15]` with {0: empty, 1: black, -1: white}

## Critical Implementation Details

### Win Detection Algorithm
For each move at position (r,c), check 4 directions: horizontal (‚Üí), vertical (‚Üì), diagonal (‚Üò), anti-diagonal (‚Üó):
- Count contiguous stones in both directions
- Win condition: exactly 5 stones AND no extension to 6+ (overline check)
- Must validate both ends don't continue with same color

### DQN Model Specifications
- **Input**: 4-channel state encoding (current player stones, opponent stones, turn plane, last-move plane)
- **Architecture**: Dueling Double-DQN with 4 conv layers + dueling heads (value + advantage)
- **Output**: 225 logits (15√ó15 board positions) with illegal move masking
- **Action mapping**: `idx = 15 * row + col`

### Training Configuration
Key hyperparameters from the development plan:
- Gamma: 0.99, Learning rate: 1e-3, Batch size: 256
- Replay capacity: 200k, Target update: soft œÑ=0.01
- Epsilon schedule: 0.30 ‚Üí 0.02 over 200k steps
- Self-play with symmetry augmentation (8 board symmetries)

## Testing Requirements

All implementations must include comprehensive tests:
- `test_board.py`: Board state, legal moves, placement validation
- `test_rules.py`: Win detection including overline cases, edge conditions
- `test_game.py`: Game flow, turn management, terminal states
- `test_masking.py`: Legal move masking for AI agents

## Performance Benchmarks

- **Heuristic vs Random**: Must achieve ‚â•80% win rate over 200 games
- **DQN vs Random**: Target ‚â•70% win rate after initial training
- **DQN vs Heuristic**: ‚â•55% win rate over ‚â•500 games for model promotion
- **GUI responsiveness**: Move latency <300ms on CPU

## File Naming and Conventions

- Use snake_case for Python files and functions
- Model files: `.pt` format with accompanying `metadata.json`
- Config files: YAML format in `config/` directory
- Transcripts: JSONL format with game metadata
- Reports: JSON format with timestamps and evaluation metrics
